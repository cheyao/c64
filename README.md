# ULX3S C64 attempts from mister

Attempt to borrow C64 mister code and compile it with opensource tools.

Currently only VIC video chip is borrowed, added sync and blank signals
required for DVI, and a bus generator to setup VIC registers.

Some picture appears 1616x300@51.6Hz on my lenovo monitor.
I'm not sure is that signal compatible with many other monitors.
