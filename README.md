# ULX3S C64 attempts from mister

Attempt to borrow [C64_MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/C64_MiSTer)
code and compile it with opensource tools.

Boot picture with "READY." prompt and blinking cursor appears
with reported resolution 1616x300@51.6Hz on my lenovo monitor.

The video signal is not likely to be compatible with every
monitor but some should work.

This repo comes with free generic ROMs from
[MEGA65](https://github.com/MEGA65/open-roms/tree/master/bin) project.
The script "getrom.sh" in "roms" directory will get real stuff for
small recompilation excercise.

Keyboard works.

Not yet supported: sound, file loading.
