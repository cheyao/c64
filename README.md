# ULX3S C64 attempts from mister

Attempt to borrow C64 mister code and compile it with opensource tools.

Correct boot picture to "READY." and blinking cursor appears
with reported resolution 1616x300@51.6Hz on my lenovo monitor.

The video signal is not likely to be compatible with every
monitor but some should work.
